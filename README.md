# mood_app
This code allows the user to create a simple journal to record their mood and thoughts on a specific date. 
The user inputs the date, mood (ranging from 1 to 10), and textual thoughts. 
The information is then stored in a separate text file with a name based on the entered date, inside the "journal" folder.
